# 1990-1999

<aside class="notes">
Let's talk fashion. The 90s had an amazing sense of style that is still being rocked today. 
Everything from overalls.... baggy clothes... and combat boots.

# Music

<aside class="notes"> 
First off Tupac was better than Biggie. I will fight you and your mama too on that. With hits like
Brenda's Got a Baby, Dear Mama, and Keep Ya Head, how could you not love him?

Next we have Aaliyah a.k.a. baby girl. She was a talented...beautiful icon that was taken away from us too soon.

# Dance Moves

<aside class="notes">
Now don't hate on the cabbage patch....the running man....or the cha-cha slide. I'm sure your dad
was practicing these moves in the mirror to get your mom. And that's why you're here today.

# Movies

<aside class="notes">
I could go on and on about movies from this era. Anything from Malcolm X, Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Friday, Set it Off, Higher learning, and of course Lion king.

# TV Shows

<aside class="notes">
Now don't come for my head if I don't mention your favorite cartoons. There were just too fire tv shows. But to name a 
few: Rugrats, Doug, Hey Arnold, Powerpuff girls, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, Amby and Dex, Daria, Cow and Chicken, basically anything from Nickelodeoneon and Cartoon network was LIT AF!

<aside class="notes">
And last but certaintly not least. I was born in 90s. August 22 I came into this world. Causing havoc and asking
my mom a million questions about why the sky was blue and why I had to go to bed so early.
Who would've known then that i would be destined to attend carolina and get my degree. Thanks mom!
