<h1>1990-1999</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Let's talk fashion. The 90s had an amazing sense of style that is still being rocked today. Everything from overalls.... baggy clothes... and combat boots.
</aside>

</section>
<section id="music" class="slide level1">
<h1>Music</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Music in the 90s paved the way for many artists today. Two noteworthy artists are Tupac and Aaliyah.
</aside>


</section>
<section id="tupac" class="slide level1">
<h1>Tupac</h1>
<aside class="notes"> 
First off Tupac was better than Biggie. I will fight you and your mama too on that. With hits like Brenda's Got a Baby, Dear Mama, and Keep Ya Head, how could you not love him?
</aside>

</section>
<section id="aaliyah" class="slide level1">
<h1>Aaliyah</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Next we have Aaliyah a.k.a. baby girl. She was a talented...beautiful icon that was taken away from us too soon.
</aside>

</section>
<section id="dance-moves" class="slide level1">
<h1>Dance Moves</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Now don't hate on the cabbage patch....the running man....or the cha-cha slide. I'm sure your dad was practicing these moves in the mirror to get your mom. And that's why you're here today.
</aside>

</section>
<section id="movies" class="slide level1">
<h1>Movies</h1>
<aside class="notes">
I could go on and on about movies from this era. Anything from Malcolm X, Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Friday, Set it Off, Higher learning, and of course Lion king.
</aside>

</section>
<section id="tv-shows" class="slide level1">
<h1>TV Shows</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Now don't come for my head if I don't mention your favorite cartoons. There were just too fire tv shows. But to name a few: Rugrats, Doug, Hey Arnold, Powerpuff girls, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, Amby and Dex, Daria, Cow and Chicken, basically anything from Nickelodeoneon and Cartoon network was LIT AF!
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
And last but certaintly not least. I was born in 90s. August 22 I came into this world. Causing havoc and asking my mom a million questions about why the sky was blue and why I had to go to bed so early. Who would've known then that i would be destined to attend carolina and get my degree. Thanks mom!
